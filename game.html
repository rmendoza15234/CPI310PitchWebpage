             Game Concept:
        <br>
            Puzzle/Hazard, Side-Scrolling Platformer with Co-Op functionality(non-network, local machine)
        <br>
            Score(based on survival time)
        <br>
            Difficulty(from object hazards)
        <br>
            Location/Design(clouds, floating islands)
        <br>
            Co-Op(one player has the power of fire, the other the power of water. Alternatively, if one player; the player can switch between the two players. Puzzle/hazard platformer)
        <br>
           Storyboarding:
        <br>
            Both of the players are creations of the overseer god, Moltonui, whose physical form is that of molten rock and mossy stone, 
        <br>
            and constantly chases the player/s across the playing field.
        <br>
            Moltonui is unhappy with his creations, and seeks to be able to remedy his mistakes.
        <br>
            The goal of Moltonui is to harness the living being’s energy, to reform them into his perfect vision. 
        <br>
            The player/s’ ultimate goal is to reach the All-stone, locked away deep in the caverns of Moltonui’s resting place, which contains the power to life; 
        <br>
            but could this be their undoing? Their alternative is equally as bleak.
