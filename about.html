		<p>This website will allow users to play a simple adventure platformer right from their browser. Our idea for the game is to use WebGL to develop a simple game using Unity game engine and having that run on our website. The character's colors will be based on our branding (purple and yellow) and we will hopefully be implementing local multiplayer along with a leaderboard system. The goal of the players will most likely be as simple as finding a key and opening a door.
			Players can log in to save their game clear time and compete with other users to achieve the fastest time. 
			Users are welcomed with a start page, where they can read what the game is about and also see the top 10 fastest clear times from other players. 
			The game will feature multiple stages in which the player must complete as fast as possible to reach the end of the game. 
			Besides the game, the website will feature multiple pages in which the user can traverse to. These include an “about us” section, login page, 
			how to play page and a highscores page. Hopefully we can successfully implement all of our ideas.
