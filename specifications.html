    <h1>Project Specifications and Details</h1>
    <br>

    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p> The purpose of our website will be to design a functional website to host an online game
        where users have the ability to create an account for said website, and use the account to
        play the hosted game, return to a created "save point" using some generated code,
        and time permitting, check their own statistics from the game and compare them to that of other users.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h3>List of Deliverables</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Front End: Customer Interface
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The game itself will be developed using <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/webgl-building.html">WebGL for Unity</a>.
                    <ul>
                        <li>The game is embedded as a part of the website</li>
                        <li>The game itself will consist of at the very least one level, with more added if time permits.</li>        
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    The website will be developed using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Bootstrap, and will consist of:

                        <li>A user login/account page link/area on the "main" page of the website</li>
